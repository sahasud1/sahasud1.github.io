In this project, we developed methodologies and codes for calculating quality indicators for breast feeding using several statistical
software (e.g.  R, SAS, SPSS, STATA). Spacial thanks to my collegues Shahriar Shams and Kaviul Anam Khan, for translating the codes in SPSS and STATA. Details are available [here](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/en/ServicesAndTools/Documents/LDCP/LDCP%20IFS%20PQ%20User%20Guide%20Final.pdf). Flowcharts are used illustrate the logic. The codes are also available in the Appendix sectioon of the document.
